TODO::
- physics objects need to deregister themselves.
- Map Editor?
- Need to implement track loader.
	- Either (because the physics is done for the current car scale):
		- All track pieces need to be scaled by 1000??
		- OR the loader needs to do the scaling.
		- OR physics needs to be scales/retuned for the smaller track size.
-

- path to model file.
- scale (if any)
- start position
	- this will be in the exact middle (width wise) of the track at the surface level at the beginning of the piece.
- end position
	- this will be in the exact middle (width wise) of the track at the surface level at the end of the piece
- orientation change (rotation around the center of the object)
	- any and all rotations that this piece introduces and the next piece needs to be positioned properly
		- EG:
			- Straight piece = no orientation change
			- 90* turn piece = 90 rotation around y axis. (eg: (0, 90, 0) )
			- 45* turn piece = 45 rotation around y axis. (eg: (0, 45, 0) )
			- floor to wall transition = 90 rotation around x axis( eg: (90, 0, 0) )

- List of track pieces
	- as track piece files are read in their orientations and positions get added together to get the position of the next piece.
- list of all triggers
