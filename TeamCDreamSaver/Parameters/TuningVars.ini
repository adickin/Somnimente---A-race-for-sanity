//This is a comment.

//blank lines are OK, will just be skipped
//To add a var, just put in like this:

roadFriction 20

//And then call VarLoader.GetDouble("roadFriction");
//will return 10 as a double
//If it can't find your var, it will attempt to reload automatically. If it still can't find, will print an error to cerr



//Physics vars start here

turnAngle 0.1
carDensity 0.05
accelerationMultiplier 4000
gravity -400
tireFriction 20

//physics vars end heres
