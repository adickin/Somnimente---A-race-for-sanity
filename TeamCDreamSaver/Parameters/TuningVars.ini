//This is a comment.

//blank lines are OK, will just be skipped
//To add a var, just put in like this:

roadFriction 10

//And then call VarLoader.GetDouble("roadFriction");
//will return 10 as a double
//If it can't find your var, it will attempt to reload automatically. If it still can't find, will print an error to cerr



//Physics vars start here

carDensity 0.05

slidingFriction 750
