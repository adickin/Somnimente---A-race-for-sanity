Somnimente

This game was made for a school project in the winter semester of 2013.  The games premise is that you are in a dream 
trying to catch the dream invader before they invade your dreams.  You are trying to destroy the invader.

Issues:
Physics is poorly tuned. The phyx api is quite confusing and over the top if you only need a simple vehicle.
Controller support is only available for windows.

During development the game was compiled using vs2010.
